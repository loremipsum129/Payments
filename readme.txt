Payments are considered to happen every 1st day of the month. 
Agreements layed down at 1st day of month will not count very 1st day as payment day.
Calculation requests made on 1st day will include that day's payment (unless it happens to be agreement day).

Pleace be advised -- programm has no failsave mechanisms whatsoever, using unexpected values will yield unpredictable results.
